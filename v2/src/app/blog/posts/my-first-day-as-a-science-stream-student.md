It was mid-2022 when I entered the science stream for the first time. On August 1, I attended my first class, and that day still feels fresh in my memory. Initially, I was really afraid because of the rumors about science being too difficult and challenging. However, as I progressed, I realized that it wasn't as tough as people said. If you stay focused and work consistently, it becomes manageable.

That day, I also met my science teachers for the first time, including my class teacher—our PGT Chemistry ma'am. For privacy reasons, I won't disclose her name, but I remember being scared of her at first because of how strict she seemed. Everyone was nervous around her. However, as time went on, a few of us stuck around and eventually discovered how amazing she truly was. Her teaching style was excellent, and the way she explained every concept was outstanding.

All the teachers were exceptional, but among them, my biology teacher became the closest to me. I was always ready to help him, whether it was for small tasks like paperwork or more exciting things like spying on someone.

The time I spent in the science stream was unforgettable—filled with valuable lessons, a great environment, and wonderful memories. During that period, I also created **Creator's World**, balancing my studies and side projects simultaneously.

Looking back, I am truly grateful for the incredible faculty and the good-hearted friends I made along the way. It was undoubtedly one of the most memorable eras of my life.
