Greetings, Discord community members! It’s been a really exciting year with lots of updates in our community and here’s what we did: We are excited to let you know that we have a new council in our community, a council made up of different voices helping to shape the direction of our server making sure it is inclusive and dynamic for everyone. And then comes nsLaboratory, which is like an incubator for developers; here you can collaborate with other developers, innovate the new idea with continuous support and resources from us.

Also, we’ve created nstypocolors – a lightweight TypeScript color package made for developers. It helps on an easy management of colors through development stages and makes designs constant across projects at all scales. We are also working on some informative Discord bot that will help to easily access information within our server. Also updated some cool features on Creator’s World Discord bot. Our brand-new website has also launched where you get all the recent update about the community, events and resources. I would like to personally thank everyone who has been part of this journey so far because without your support and engagement in my post festivities I would not have come this far. With much more excitement coming from each member I am optimistic that together we are heading towards achieving more success ahead but just before that we have to work hard together!
